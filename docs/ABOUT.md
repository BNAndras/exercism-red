# About

[Red](https://www.red-lang.org)'s characteristics mostly come from the fact, that the basis of its creation was [Rebol](http://www.rebol.com), and Red's development started as an open source community alternative. In the meantime, Rebol's development has stopped, and Red is constantly evolving.

## Rebol legacy

Just as Rebol, Red is a **general purpose** programming language, you can use it to create any application you want. To be as familiar to developers as possible, **multiple paradigms** are implemented: *imperative*, *functional*, *object*, *symbolic*, *reactive*. Although it's entire toolchain fits in 1.5 MB download, it has **Graphical User Interface** implementations for all major operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) and no dependencies on external libraries.

Red strives to be **as simple as possible**. It's designed by making most usable compromises and choosing sensible defaults, to allow to complete every task without being overwhelmed by number of choices. It's focused on human **readability**, so syntax sugar is reduced to minimum and programs try to resemble sentences of natural language. As a result, Red and Rebol are [highly expressive](https://redmonk.com/dberkholz/2013/03/25/programming-languages-ranked-by-expressiveness/).

Unusual value of Red is it's **homoiconicity**, so a Red program can be manipulated just as any Red data structure. Hence, Red and Rebol are also a data formats. Fun fact is, that [JSON was inspired by Rebol](http://www.rebol.com/article/0522.html).

## Red

Comparing to Rebol, Red has been greatly improved. It can be **compiled** to a single executable for every supported platform, using any of them. So, you can compile Windows programs on Linux or macOS programs on Windows. There is also a **REPL console** available, both commandline and graphical, which enables instant manipulation of data with Red commands by typing them one-by-one.

What also differentiates Red, is it's dialect, Red/System, which makes Red a **full stack** language, allowing development of low-level code like in C.

## Mission

* Bring **fun** back into programming
* Fight software complexity

## Development

Red is open source, development is hosted in [GitHub repository](https://github.com/red/red). Currently, project is in **alpha stage**, so expect things to change and break.
