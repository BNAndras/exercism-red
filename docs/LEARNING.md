# Learning

As Red is not really a finished product (alpha-stage), everything changes fast. As a result, not many tutorials are available, and not much documentation in general. Red is just gaining its popularity. There are some pages worth mentioning though, that can help you with starting your journey.

* [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/red/) stands out as a pretty modern and not very elaborative resource.
* [Helpin'Red](http://helpin.red/) is a really comprehensive step-by-step guide with lots of examples you can try by yourself.
* [Getting Started With Red](http://redprogramming.com/Getting%20Started.html) is another classic.
* As Red is based on Rebol, you can find a lot of useful info in [Learn REBOL](http://www.re-bol.com/rebol.html), by the same author.
* If you get stuck, there is always someone ready to help you on [Red Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/red/help).
