# Help

Red has a built-in help system, which is available in Red's console. Every built-in function is documented there. Just enter `help` and follow instructions.

Red's [official documentation](https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/SUMMARY.adoc) is a work in progress, so it probably will be needed to be supplemented with some other materials.

* Lots of functions are described on [Red By Example](https://www.red-by-example.org/) page.
* Also, very extensive, although unofficial [Red Language Specification](https://github.com/meijeru/red.specs-public/blob/master/specs.adoc) is available.
* The best place to get fast help is [Red's Gitter Help channel](https://gitter.im/red/help), where you can chat with friendly community.
