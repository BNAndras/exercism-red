## Contributing

Please see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/exercism/legacy-docs/tree/master/contributing-to-language-tracks). This track is currently at the beginning of it's creation, so any help is very welcome.

### Exercise ideas

Generally, [practice exercises](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/main/anatomy/tracks/practice-exercises.md) are best taken from [Exercism's problem-specifications repository](https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications), so the experience is similar for students in every language track. But in case you need some fresh ideas, here are some links with script examples you can check for inspiration:

* http://redprogramming.com/Short%20Red%20Code%20Examples.html#section-2
* https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BLINKS%5D-Scripts-collection

Scripts in Rebol (it's very similar to Red)
